<p>Dear {{temp.client_fname}} {{temp.client_lname}},</p>
<br>
<p>Hope this e-mail finds you well.</p><br>

<p>We are now on the final stages of our recruitment process. On this email you will find the quotation form for your chosen staff:
     <strong>{{temp.cand}}</strong>.
</p><br>

<p>Please click <a href="{{temp.link}}"  style="font-size: 15px;">here</a> to view and have a read through of the quotation including the
   Service Agreement copy. Let me know if you have any questions.</p><br>

<p>Please confirm your acceptance by clicking the <strong>“I Accept the Remote Staff Service Agreement and would like to continue with the
    process”</strong> button that you will find at the middle of the page. I will then receive a notice that finalises our agreement.
    Without me receiving your acceptance, we will not be able to extend any formal offer to your chosen Remote Staff. If I do not
    hear from you within 2 business days, I will make sure to give you a follow up phone call.
</p><br>

<p>Kindly allow us 3-4 business days for the hiring process upon receipt of the documents. We require this type of time frame as
    we want to take away the hassle of the administrative items from you as well as to have time to settle the invoice first
    before the staff starts.
</p><br>

<p>It is a pleasure working with you through the hiring process. I am now looking forward to helping you make this relationship
    work for you and your organisation.
</p><br>

<p>Let me know if you have any questions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<br>

<p><strong>{{temp.admin_name}} {{temp.admin_lname}}</strong><br>
    {{temp.signature|safe}}
</p>
