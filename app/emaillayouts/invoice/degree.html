	Hi {{ doc.client_fname|title }} {{ doc.client_lname|title }},
	
	<br>
	<br>

	Good day.<br><br>
	
	Hope this email finds you all well.<br><br>
	
	Please could we bring your attention to <strong>Tax Invoice Number {{ doc.order_id }}</strong>
	sent to you on the {{ doc.added_on_str }} which is now overdue.
	
	<br><br>
	
	We would appreciate your urgent attention on raising the next payment for us as the balance on your
	account is at ({{ doc.currency }} {% if doc.currency == 'GBP' %}&#163;{% else %}${% endif %}{{ doc.running_balance_str }} ) and we have been manually activating your account for the last few days 
	so your staff could work.
	
	<br><br>
	
	On ____________________  will be the last day that we will manually activate your account 
	and when your staff logs out, your account will be automatically on temporary hold due to negative balance 
	as Invoice above has not been paid yet.
	
	<br><br>
	
	If already paid, please disregard this email and send us the details of your payment to accounts@remotestaff.com.au so we can update your account.
	
	<br><br>
	
	We will be happy to help should you have any queries.
	
	<br><br>
	
	Thank you for your time on this matter.

	Regards,

	<br>
	<br>
	
	As you know we have been actively chasing payment from you, I had been making phone
	calls and emails, asking for overdue amount to be remitted, To date I have not received any
	response, last advise was on the _______________________ saying payment will be made on that same
	week (previous conversation with Client should there be one).
	
	<br>
	<br>
	
	We ask that you contact us immediately regarding this matter or advise us as to when this
	amount will be settled because we don't want to put pressure on your
	with your staff/s because of outstanding payroll payment of invoices.
	
	
	<br>
	<br>
	
	<strong>We don't mean to be difficult but we will not be able to continue to allow your staff to
	work for you until we hear an update from you and these are all settled</strong>.<br>
	I hope you would also understand the importance of paying your monthly invoice on time, as this would serve
	as security to your staffâ€™s monthly pay.
	
	<br>
	<br>
	
	Our preference is to get the account paid up to date in order to avoid any further action.

	<br>

	<br>
	<br>
	Thank you.
